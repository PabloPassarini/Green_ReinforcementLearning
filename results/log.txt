[codecarbon WARNING @ 14:22:51] We saw that you have a 13th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1365U but we don't know it. Please contact us.
[codecarbon WARNING @ 14:22:51] We will use the default power consumption of 4 W per thread for your 12 CPU, so 48W.
[codecarbon INFO @ 14:22:51] Tracking Intel CPU via RAPL interface
[codecarbon INFO @ 14:22:53]    RAPL - Using psys (platform/system) domain (rapl_prefer_psys=True). Note: psys includes CPU + platform components (chipset, PCIe, etc.) and may report higher values than CPU TDP spec.
[codecarbon INFO @ 14:22:53]    RAPL - Package domains available but not used due to rapl_prefer_psys=True
[codecarbon INFO @ 14:22:53]    RAPL - Selected 1 unique RAPL domain(s) after deduplication
[codecarbon INFO @ 14:22:53]    RAPL - Monitoring domain 'psys' (displayed as 'Processor Energy Delta_0(kWh)') via MSR at /sys/class/powercap/intel-rapl/subsystem/intel-rapl/intel-rapl:1/energy_uj
